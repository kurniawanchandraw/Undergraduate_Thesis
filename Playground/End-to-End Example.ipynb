    "*Varying Coefficients Model* (VCM) is a statistical model that allows the coefficients of predictor variables to vary across different levels of a categorical variable or over time. This flexibility enables the model to capture complex relationships between the predictors and the response variable that may not be adequately represented by a traditional linear regression model with fixed coefficients. VCMs are particularly useful in situations where the effect of a predictor variable on the response variable is expected to change based on certain conditions or contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base VCM can be represented mathematically as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_i = \\beta_0(z_i) + \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_j(z_i) x_{ij} + \\varepsilon_i, \\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $y_i$ is the response variable for the $i$-th observation.\n",
    "- $z_i$ is the vector of covariates that may affect the coefficients.\n",
    "- $\\beta_0(z_i)$ is the intercept term that varies with $z_i$.\n",
    "- $\\beta_j(z_i)$ are the coefficients for the predictor variables $x_{ij}$ that also vary with $z_i$.\n",
    "- $\\epsilon_i$ is the error term for the $i$-th observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the implementation of a Geographically and Temporally Varying Coefficients Model (GTVCM) using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The GTVCM extends the traditional VCM by allowing the coefficients to vary not only with covariates but also across different geographical locations and time periods. This is particularly useful in scenarios where spatial and temporal dependencies play a significant role in the relationships being modeled."

    "## **1.1. Relationship Between WLS and VCM**\n",
    "\n",
    "Weighted Least Squares (WLS) and Varying Coefficients Models (VCM) are both statistical techniques used to analyze relationships between variables, but they have different underlying assumptions and applications. WLS is a generalization of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression that allows for heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance of the error terms) by assigning different weights to different observations. In WLS, the weights are typically chosen based on the inverse of the variance of the observations, giving more importance to observations with lower variance. The WLS estimator can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{\\boldsymbol\\beta}_{\\mathrm{WLS}} = (\\bm{X}^\\top \\mathbf{W} \\bm{X})^{-1} \\bm{X}^\\top \\mathbf{W} \\bm{y}, \\tag{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{W}$ is a diagonal matrix of weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, VCM allows the coefficients of the predictor variables to vary as functions of other covariates. This means that instead of having a single coefficient for each predictor variable, VCM estimates a function for each coefficient that can change based on the values of the covariates. This flexibility allows VCM to capture more complex relationships in the data that may not be adequately represented by a fixed-coefficient model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while both WLS and VCM are used to model relationships between variables, WLS focuses on addressing heteroscedasticity by weighting observations, whereas VCM allows for coefficients to vary based on covariates, providing a more flexible modeling approach."

    "Several studies have explored the application of Varying Coefficients Models (VCM) in various fields, including environmental science, epidemiology, and social sciences. For instance, Hastie and Tibshirani (1993) introduced the concept of VCM and demonstrated its utility in modeling non-linear relationships in data. They showed that VCM could effectively capture the varying effects of predictors on the response variable across different levels of a covariate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Du, et al. proposed a model called Geographically Neural Networks Weighted Regression (GNNWR) that integrates MLP with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to capture spatial heterogeneity in data. The GNNWR model leverages the power of GNNs to learn complex spatial relationships and improve the estimation of varying coefficients across different geographical locations."
